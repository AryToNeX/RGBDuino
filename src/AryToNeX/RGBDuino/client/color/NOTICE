This library was slightly modified by me (Anthony Calabretta) to better
suit my needs.
However, if you are looking for the original library,
it can be found at:

What was modified:
- No composer needed
- The library namespace (I am noob and I feel comfortable having everything in a single namespace)
- PHP7 additions (typehint everything and return hints)
- the "Color" class (renamed to ColorUtils, added a method for color mixing, added more conversion utils)
